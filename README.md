# 📁 My Projects

Hello! 👋  
Welcome to my **Projects** folder. I’m a first-year student, and I have just started learning **Web Development**. This is the place where I will upload all the projects I build while learning.

Right now, I am doing **small and simple projects**, but soon I will build **bigger and full-stack apps** as I learn more.

## 📌 What you will find here

This folder will have:
- Small and basic web development projects
- Some beginner Python or JavaScript projects
- Each project in its own folder
- A short README file inside each project folder

I will keep updating this folder with new projects as I build them.
